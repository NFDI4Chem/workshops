# Introduction

NFDI4Chem is facilitating and organising a series of international workshops in different subdisciplines of chemistry to develop domain-specific MI standards. Each of the developed standards will be a modular recommendation for Minimum Information on Chemical Investigations due to the sheer size and variability of the field. Prior to the publication of the standards, there will be a Request for Comments (RFC) as part of a public review of the standards. We are providing this platform to receive the comments from the broadest possible community.


## Content

For each workshop, we provide an overview about the topics discussed with a link to the full workshop record, along with forms to hear from you about your comments and thoughts, and other related links.+
