## Recommendations Standard for Reporting Liquid-State NMR Experiments of Small Molecules
This recommendations standard is a proposal from [NFDI4Chem](https://www.nfdi4chem.de/) of what metadata to report for liquid-state NMR experiments of small molecules. We aim to make it suitable for NMR repositories and the supplementary materials of publications, not for the metadata in the experiment section. Therefore, we want to emphasize that the chemist doesn't need to enter their data in the recommended format as long as the repository is capable of converting it. For instance, the user might only upload NMR datasets, then NMRium extracts the solvent, and the repository does the mapping to the CHEBI instance.

While forging this standard, we have considered two aspects: How to make sense of the data on the first hand, where we need the minimum mentioned here in the first level, and data traceability and reproducibility, where details like the number of scans and the instrument become very useful, so we asked for them in the second level.

The recommendations started with metadata for reporting NMR analyses of synthetic compounds only, covering the reaction leading to the analyzed product. Then the decision was taken to split the recommendations and remove the synthetic compounds section to make them more modular and broader to cover all small molecules, including natural products, synthetic compounds, and mixtures where we have known molecules. They also started by making crucial and automatically extractable metadata ([by NMRium](https://www.nmrium.org/)) mandatory, which can encourage chemists to use automatic workflows, and we made metadata relevant to impurities recommended. However, for historical data, authors might fail to submit with restricted minimum information (MI), which led to the decision to keep automatically extractable metadata recommended if it wasn't crucial.
