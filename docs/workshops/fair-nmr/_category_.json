    "description": "NFDI4Chem in collaboration with IUPAC have organised a workshop on FAIR NMR Research Data Management where we had experts who have been contributing to the FAIRness and standardisation of NMR data to participate in identifying challenges and finding solutions in this area. The discussions covered NMR repositories in NFDI4Chem and how to make their data more findable and interoperable, along with terminology, file formats, implementations and validations. We aimed at establishing a solid ground for a broader discussion that will follow in the next analytical chemistry MIChI workshops."
