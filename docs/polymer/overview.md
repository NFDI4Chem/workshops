## Introduction
### Data Life Cycle
![Data Life Cycle](@site/static/img/cycle.png)
In this cycle, the ELN role comes mainly in the Experiment/Data Collection step, where acquisition and documentation can happen, while repositories facilitate the data Disclosure and Publication. Those repositories include RADAR4Chem, which is a generic repository where we have the flexibility, but we miss the structure needed. Another repository is Chemotion. Both are open to all countries.

### NFDI4Chem Support for Data Publication
- [Lead-by-example](https://www.nfdi4chem.de/index.php/2022/02/02/data-pledge-lets-lead-by-example-2/): We would like to collect datasets that are as complete as possible today using the tools developed in NFDI4Chem.
- [NFDI4Chem helpdesk](https://www.nfdi4chem.de/index.php/helpdesk/): It provide consulting on how to structure the data.
- [NFDI4Chem workshop series on RDM (Research Data Management)](https://www.nfdi4chem.de/index.php/event/workshop-fair-research-data-management-basics-for-chemists/):
We provide talks and receive questions. Registration is open, and we have many events coming. The workshops (online) are open to all people, and internationalization is part of our mission.

### The Minimum Information on Chemistry Investigations (MIChI)
Data needs to be associated with metadata, otherwise, data loses context. Metadata can be domain independent (funder, publisher, author, dates..) or specific, as in the domain of chemistry. We are especially interested in the Minimum Information subset out of the metadata, which we call minimum information on Chemistry investigation (MIChI). We can store the MIChI standards on specific repositories like FAIRsharing.

We would like to provide our MIChI as:
- Guidelines article: Useful for students and researchers.
- Checklist for authors
- Data Model: A conceptual idea for the programmers.
- Ontology terms: to support the MIChI. 
- Implementation can happen in ELNs and repositories, and behind the scene, you have the APIs, databases, and the file formats.

Structured data can be tedious work, but it saves a lot of time later when we need to publish, it is also essential for reusability

### Publication with Chemotion
Using Chemotion ELN or repository, one can generate reports that contain the description, the reaction scheme, identifiers and information coming from the identifiers (such as the molecular mass). If the data comes from the repository, the report contains its DOI. Supplemental information then can be submitted to the journals.
If the data is already published in journals, corresponding links can be added to the “Reference” section.

Supplemental information is already partially standardized for organic chemistry but not completely, as standardized elements such as the names and identifiers are being used in larger non-standardized sections, such as the description and results.
