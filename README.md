## About The Workshops
NFDI4Chem is developing domain-specific MI standards in a series of workshops in different subdisciplines of chemistry facilitated and organised by NFDI4Chem. Each of the developed standards will be a modular recommendation for Minimum Information on Chemical Investigations (MIChIs). This website serves as a documentation hub for the proposed MIChIs and provides insights into the workshops conducted to refine and advance these standards.
