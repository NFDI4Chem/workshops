The discussions covered NMR repositories in NFDI4Chem and how to make their data more findable and interoperable, along with terminology, file formats, implementations and validations. We aimed at establishing a solid ground for a broader discussion that will follow in the next analytical chemistry MIChI workshops.","slug":"/category/fair-nmr-research-data-management","permalink":"/docs/category/fair-nmr-research-data-management","navigation":{"previous":{"title":"Introduction","permalink":"/docs/intro"},"next":{"title":"Workshop Overview","permalink":"/docs/fair-nmr/overview"}}}')}}]);
